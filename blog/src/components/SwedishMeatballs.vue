      I always loved eating swedish meatballs while growing up. They were one of
      my favorite recipes that my mother prepared. She hated doing it, mostly
      because she made the meatballs from scratch and that took a ton of work.
    </p>

      She always wanted to make sure that we got enough food while growing up so
      she used egg noodles to add in some extra carbs. The creamy sauce poured
      over the egg noodles, mixed in with the savory meatballs was always to die
      for in my opinion.
    </p>

      I have tried a couple different recipes over the years, including the one
      that she supposedly used during my childhood years. I tried some frozen,
      pre-made meals as well. Nothing every turned out quite as I remembered it.
    </p>
    <p class="left-align">
      I decided to find a recipe on my own. I found one but it just wasn't quite
      right, so I tweaked it to my own liking. That recipe, swedish meatballs,
      is the recipe above. The sauce is so creamy and delectable. Almost any
      type of noodle can be used, such as: penne, rigatoni, elbow, fettucine,
      egg noodles, etc. I recommend this to anyone who is looking for a
      delicious, mouthwatering meal.
